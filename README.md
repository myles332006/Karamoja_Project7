# Karamoja Project Group 7

## Project Overview
This project, performed by Group 7, was developed to support the NGOs working in Karamoja, Uganda, the country's most food-insecure region. The tools provide insights into sorghum and maize yields during the crop season, using geographical estimates combined with population data.

The work consists of:
1) A Tableau Dashboard showcasing interactive visualizations. (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/myles.imbayi/vizzes)
2) A Jupyter notebook that reproduces what the Tableau analyses programmatically, together with appropriate Exploratory Data Analysis.
